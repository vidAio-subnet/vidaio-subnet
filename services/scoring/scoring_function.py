    Calculate compression score that rewards hitting VMAF threshold with good compression.
    
    Scoring Philosophy:
    - Compression is primary goal (70% weight by default)
    - VMAF at/above threshold is rewarded with diminishing returns (30% weight)
    - 15x compression ratio = 1.0 compression component
    - Exceeding VMAF threshold gives modest bonus (not penalty)
    
    Three scoring zones:
    1. Below hard cutoff (threshold - 5): Score = 0
    2. Soft zone (threshold - 5 to threshold): Gradual recovery
    3. Above threshold: Full scoring with quality bonus
    
    Args:
        vmaf_score: VMAF quality score (0-100)
        compression_rate: Size ratio compressed/original (0-1, lower is better)
        vmaf_threshold: Required VMAF threshold (e.g., 85, 90, 95)
        compression_weight: Weight for compression component (default: 0.70)
        quality_weight: Weight for quality component (default: 0.30)
        soft_threshold_margin: Points below threshold before hard cutoff (default: 5.0)
