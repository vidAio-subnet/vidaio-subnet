## **1. Introduction**
vidAIo's mission is to democratize video enhancement through decentralization, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. Leveraging the Bittensor ecosystem, vidAIo provides creators, businesses, and developers with scalable, affordable, and high-quality video upscaling solutions while ensuring full ownership and control over their content


## 2. Subnet Architecture

### 2.1 Overview
- **Miners**: Handle video upscaling tasks and optimize models to ensure high-quality outputs.
- **Validators**: Assess miner performance using predefined metrics to maintain network integrity.

### 2.2 Miners
Miners enhance video quality using AI-driven upscaling techniques. They can:
- Optimize open-source models or develop proprietary ones for superior results.
- Handle video upscaling requests from validators and end-users.

### 2.3 Validators
Validators ensure miners deliver consistent, high-quality results by evaluating performance through synthetic and organic queries.

### 2.4 Synapses
#### 2.4.1 Synthetic Query
Validators benchmark miner performance using controlled datasets:
- Downscale a high-resolution video to low-resolution.
- Miners upscale the low-resolution video back to high.
- Validators assess the upscaled output using metrics VMAF, LPIPS and latency.

#### 2.4.2 Organic Query
Real-world video data uploaded by users is processed as follows:
- Videos are chunked and queued for miners.
- Miners process and upscale the chunks.
- Results are aggregated and delivered back to users.

## 4. Roadmap

### Phase 1: Implementing the Upscaling Synapse
- Launch the subnet with AI-powered video upscaling.
- Focus on real-time processing of low-quality videos into high-definition formats.

### Phase 2: Developing an AI-Powered Video Compression Model
- Build AI models for adaptive bitrate streaming.
- Optimize bandwidth usage while maintaining video quality.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Transcode Optimization Synapse
- Introduce AI-driven transcoding for compatibility across devices.
- Evaluate miners on speed, quality, and efficiency.

### Phase 4: On-Demand Streaming Architecture
- Enable decentralized on-demand video streaming with integrated storage.
- Utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) models for redundancy and high availability.

### Phase 5: Live Streaming Through the Subnet
- Introduce live streaming with real-time AI-powered upscaling and transcoding.
- Integrate adaptive bitrate streaming for smooth playback.

### Phase 6: Subnet API for Real-World Integration
- Develop a RESTful API for seamless integration with external platforms.
- Include features for uploading, processing, and retrieving videos.
